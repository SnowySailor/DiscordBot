# DiscordBot
Discord bot written with Discord.py

# Setup
You may need to create a `logs` directory in the application root. This will hold the message logs for the markov fuctionality. Each server's messages are stored in their own file.

Configure a config.yaml based on the example.

# TODO

2. Configure audio playback
3. Allow use with youtube-dl to play songs
